    "**In recent years, heightened concerns over climate change and air pollution have drawn significant attention to sustainable transportation. Electric vehicles (EVs) and hybrid vehicles are gaining traction across the United States, particularly in eco-conscious states like Washington. These vehicles are essential for reducing greenhouse gas emissions and lowering dependency on fossil fuels. Additionally, rising fuel prices are prompting more consumers to consider electric or fuel-efficient hybrid options.** \n",
    "\n",
    "**Although both governments and businesses actively promote the electric vehicle market, consumer preferences vary considerably by region, especially in the choice between hybrid vehicles and battery electric vehicles (BEVs). Understanding these regional preferences offers valuable insights for assessing market demand and shaping policies that support a smoother transition toward electrification in the transportation sector.**\n",

In a study by Nelder and Jung (2016)<a name=\"cite_ref-1.1\"></a>[<sup>1</sup>](#cite_note-1.1), factors influencing the adoption of EVs were examined, including the distribution of charging infrastructure, vehicle range, and geographic characteristics. These factors significantly impact the efficiency of both hybrid and electric vehicles, influencing consumer preferences for each type across different areas.**\n",

    "**Another relevant study by Morrissey et al. (2016)<a name=\"cite_ref-1.2\"></a>[<sup>2</sup>](#cite_note-1.2) analyzed EV adoption patterns in several European countries, focusing on urban versus rural regions. They found that urban consumers were more inclined to choose BEVs due to readily available charging infrastructure, whereas rural areas favored hybrids, given their flexibility in regions with limited charging options. This research supports the notion that consumer preferences for hybrids and BEVs may vary based on infrastructure and geography, aligning closely with our research question of whether statistically significant preference differences exist across Washington counties.**\n",
